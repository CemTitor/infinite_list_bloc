## Getting Started

- Observe state changes with BlocObserver.
- BlocProvider, Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
- BlocBuilder, Flutter widget that handles building the widget in response to new states.
- Adding events with context.read.⚡
- Prevent unnecessary rebuilds with Equatable.
- Use the transformEvents method with Rx.

The application uses a feature-driven directory structure. This project structure enables us to scale the project by having self-contained features. In this example we will only have a single feature (the post feature) and it's split up into respective folders with barrel files, indicated by the asterisk (*).
